                    <div class="recipe-line"></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1 cup milk</li>
                        <li>1 large egg</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <div class="recipe-line"></div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                        <li>In another bowl, beat the egg and then whisk in the milk, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract if using.</li>
                        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
                        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
                        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
                        <li>Remove the pancakes from the skillet and keep them warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
                        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or butter. Enjoy!</li>
