                    <ul>
                        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
                        <li>1 packet taco seasoning mix</li>
                        <li>12 small corn or flour tortillas</li>
                        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
                        <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup chopped onions (optional)</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro (optional)</li>
                        <li>Sour cream and salsa for serving (optional)</li>

                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <div class="recipe-line"></div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned and fully cooked, breaking it apart with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                        <li>Add the taco seasoning mix and the amount of water specified on the seasoning packet (usually about 2/3 cup). Stir to combine and let it simmer for about 5 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
                        <li>While the beef is cooking, warm the tortillas. You can do this by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for about 30 seconds, or by heating them in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side.</li>
                        <li>Assemble the tacos by placing a few spoonfuls of the seasoned beef onto each tortilla. Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, chopped onions, and cilantro as desired.</li>
                        <li>Add a dollop of sour cream and salsa if you like.</li>
                        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious homemade tacos!</li>
